# Blood on the Clocktower homebrew script - The Third Testament
## Intro
This is a unofficial script for a social deduction game [Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/). All characters are homebrew and will be further play-tested and fine-tuned soon. 

The script is recommended for expert players looking for additional game content. Minions are made very powerful to aid a bit weaker demons. Players will die and become alive again. Alignments and characters will change often. Good players can look forward to solving complex riddles.  

- **Storyteller complexity:** 4/5
- **Player complexity:** 4/5

## Running the script
Feel free to use any characters for your games, make modifications and leave suggestions. Once some more playtesting has been done I will add all print resources.
There may still be some game-breaking mechanics so don't expect a completely smooth playthrough yet.

You can use the script in [Clocktower online tool](https://clocktower.online/) by importing or pasting a [script JSON file](https://github.com/adambrenkus/botc-dt/blob/main/chars.json). Night orders and reminders should be available, althought there may still be some mistakes.
